## Networking

### IP
IP, the Internet Protocol's primary focus is to get individual packets from one host to another.

### TCP
TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, is built on top of IP. It responds to dropped packets by requesting retransmits.

### HTTP
HTTP, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is build on top of TCP.

### HTTPS
HTTPS is HTTP with SSL encryption. 

### DNS
DNS is the system which translates domain names to numerical IP addresses. For example, www.google.com translates to 216.58.218.110. DNS is implemented as a distributed directory service. Each DNS server stores a database of domain names to IP addresses. If it cannot find a domain name being queried in this database, it forwards the request to other DNS servers. To improve performance, caching is heavily used.
