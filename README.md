## Networking

### IP
IP, the Internet Protocol's primary focus is to get individual packets from one host to another.

### TCP
TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, is built on top of IP. It responds to dropped packets by requesting retransmits.

### HTTP
HTTP, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is build on top of TCP.

### HTTPS
HTTPS is HTTP with SSL encryption. 

### DNS
DNS is the system which translates domain names to numerical IP addresses. For example, www.google.com translates to 216.58.218.110. DNS is implemented as a distributed directory service. Each DNS server stores a database of domain names to IP addresses. If it cannot find a domain name being queried in this database, it forwards the request to other DNS servers. To improve performance, caching is heavily used.

## Object Oriented Programming

### Favor Composition Over Inheritance
Code reuse should be achieved by assembling smaller units of functionality instead of inheriting from classes. In other words, use can-do, has-a, or uses-a relationships instead of is-a relationships.

## System Design

### Stateless/Stateful System
A stateless system's output depends only on the input. A stateful system's output depends on the input and internal state. Therefore, the same set of input can generate different output. This makes multiple actors accessing the system a trickier problem.


## Database

### Relational Database
A relational database is a set of tables. Each table consists of rows. A row is a set of columns, which could be of various types. SQL is the language used to create and manipulate such databases. A key benefit of relational databases include support for ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.


### Normalization/Denomalization
Database normalization is to organize the database so as to minimize redunduncy. It involves decomposing tables utilizing foreign keys (a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table). Denormalization on the other hand, adds redundant data to one or more tables so as to avoid expensive joins and improve performance. However, extra effort to update the database consistently (multiple fields to update at one time) and more storage are necessary.

### JOIN
Join is used to combine the results of two tables. To perform a join, each of the tables must have at least one field that will be used to find matching records from the other table.<br/>
Inner Join: The result set would contain only the data where the criteria match.<br/>
Outer Join: The result set also contains records that have no matching. The unmatched field will have a NULL value.<br/> 
Left Outer Join: The result will contain all records from the left table regardless of match.<br/>
Rgith Outer Join: The result will contain all records from the right table regardless of match.<br/>
Full Outer Join: The result will contain all records from both the left and right table regardless of match.<br/>

## JavaScript

### Contrast Prototypal Inheritance with Class Inheritance
In class inheritance, instances inherit from classes and create hierarchical sub-class relationships. Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the 'new' keyword. In prototypal inheritance, instances inherit directly from other objects and may be composed from many different objects, allowing easy selective inheritance. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or 'Object.create()'.

### == and ===
== allows coercion in the equality comparison
=== disallows coercion in the equality comparison.

### Falsy values / Truthy values
Falsy values are, undefined, null, false, +0, -0, and NaN, ””.
All others are Truthy values.

### NaN
A special value given when Number coercion fails.
