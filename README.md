#### DNS
DNS is the system which translates domain names to numerical IP addresses. For example, www.google.com translates to 216.58.218.110. DNS is implemented as a distributed directory service. Each DNS server stores a database of domain names to IP addresses. If it cannot find a domain name being queried in this database, it forwards the request to other DNS servers. To improve performance, caching is heavily used.
